# About 

This is a work in progress and could have bugs. The repo is code for research on adversarial learning simulations. Feedback is appreciated. 

# To Do

* Implement the adversarial aspect of mRMR
* Implement the JMI calculations. This requries new functions in the `infotheory.py` file to perform these calculations. 
* Implement the adversarial aspect of JMI
* Experiments, experiments, experiments...
